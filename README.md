- Classify customer potential

Like most companies, Red Hat is able to gather a great deal of information over time about the behavior of individuals who interact with them. They’re in search of better methods of using this behavioral data to predict which individuals they should approach—and even when and how to approach them.

In this competition, Kagglers are challenged to create a classification algorithm that accurately identifies which customers have the most potential business value for Red Hat based on their characteristics and activities.

With an improved prediction model in place, Red Hat will be able to more efficiently prioritize resources to generate more business and better serve their customers.

# Sub Project
### [Shelter Animal Outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes)

Every year, approximately 7.6 million companion animals end up in US shelters. Many animals are given up as unwanted by their owners, while others are picked up after getting lost or taken out of cruelty situations. Many of these animals find forever families to take them home, but just as many are not so lucky. 2.7 million dogs and cats are euthanized in the US every year.

- Help improve outcomes for shelter animals

Using a dataset of intake information including breed, color, sex, and age from the [Austin Animal Center](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/aac), we're asking Kagglers to predict the outcome for each animal.

We also believe this dataset can help us understand trends in animal outcomes. These insights could help shelters focus their energy on specific animals who need a little extra help finding a new home. We encourage you to publish your insights on [Scripts](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes/kernels) so they are publicly accessible.

Kaggle is hosting this competition for the machine learning community to use for data science practice and social good. The dataset is brought to you by [Austin Animal Center](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/aac). Shelter animal statistics were taken from the [ASPCA](https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics).
